# üí´ About Me:
With about 3.5+ years of work experience as a seasoned Data Scientist, I have navigated the landscapes of various industry domains, including CPG, marketing analytics, and management consulting where I have skillfully wielded a vast array of tools and technologies, such as Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. Focusing on data-intensive applications, my accomplishments, and substantial contributions led to greater exposure, where I managed a team, ensuring timely deliverables, mentoring the new inductees, and working with individuals across the world on multifaceted problems that required holistic solutions, enhancing my interpersonal skills that facilitated client relationships.

As a graduate student at the University of Chicago, I am actively pursuing my Masters in Applied Data Science with an unwavering drive to unravel the intricacies of data science and artificial intelligence. With a strong foundation in machine learning and analytics, I bring a fresh and unique perspective to the field of data science. I am continually searching for innovative ways to apply my skills, from competing in hackathons to exploring the frontiers of automation and data science. My inquisitive nature and passion for AI have further heightened my fascination and dedication to mastering advanced technologies such as deep learning and big data and applying them to real-world challenges.

Feel free to message me and talk about anything. If I can be of any help, it would be my pleasure!
